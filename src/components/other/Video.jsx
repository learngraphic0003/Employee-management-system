 <h1 className='text-blue-500'> How to Execute the Task Efficiently: </h1> 
Plan Ahead: Start by reviewing the brand guidelines and understanding the task. Make a quick outline of how you’ll approach it.  <br />

Use Templates: If there are templates or previous banners, reference them for consistency. <br />

Set Milestones: Break the task into smaller steps (e.g., Step 1: Design layout, Step 2: Incorporate content, Step 3: Final review) and set personal deadlines for each. <br />

Ask for Feedback Early: Don’t wait until the last minute to ask for feedback. Getting it early on will allow you to adjust the design before submitting it. <br />
Steps to Complete the Task:
Understand the Brand:

Familiarize yourself with the brand guidelines (colors, typography, logo usage) that you’ll need to follow.

Make sure to use the latest brand assets (logo, color palette).
